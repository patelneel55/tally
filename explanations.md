# SEC Filings API Endpoint Fixes

## Problem Overview

The SEC filings endpoints were returning empty responses or "Not Found" errors due to several issues:

1. **Router Configuration Issues**:
   - Both `sec_analysis.router` and `sec_routes.router` were included with the same `/sec` prefix
   - `sec_routes.py` was defining its router with an additional `/sec` prefix
   - This created a double prefix (effectively `/sec/sec/...`) that didn't match client requests

2. **SEC API Integration Problems**:
   - The SEC API endpoint URL was incorrectly implemented in the `_query_sec_filings` method
   - The correct endpoint needed the `/query` suffix

3. **Error Handling Deficiencies**:
   - API errors were propagating as HTTP 500 errors rather than being handled gracefully
   - The endpoint wasn't properly handling empty results or API failures

4. **Response Processing Issues**:
   - The response parsing from the SEC API needed improvements

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Router Configuration Fix
Changed the router prefix in `ai_analyst/app/api/api.py`:
```python
# Include SEC historical analysis endpoints
api_router.include_router(
    sec_routes.router,
    prefix="/sec-data",  # Changed from "/sec" to "/sec-data" to avoid conflict
    tags=["sec-data"]    # Updated tags for better organization
)
```

### 2. SEC API Integration Fix
Fixed the API endpoint URL in `ai_analyst/app/services/sec_fetcher.py`:
```python
async with session.post(
    f"{SEC_QUERY_API_ENDPOINT}/query",  # Added the /query path to the base endpoint
    headers=headers,
    json=query_payload
) as response:
```

### 3. Improved Error Handling
Enhanced the error handling in `ai_analyst/app/api/endpoints/sec_routes.py`:
- Added more detailed logging
- Ensured proper response formatting for empty results
- Added traceback logging for easier debugging

### 4. Better Response Processing
Improved response processing in the `get_sec_filings` endpoint:
- Added type checking for the primary document field
- Added proper error handling for each filing in the response
- Improved data formatting and structure

### 5. Legacy Endpoint Support
Added a legacy endpoint to support clients still using the old URL pattern:
```python
@router.get("/legacy/{symbol}/filings")
async def legacy_get_sec_filings(
    symbol: str = Path(..., description="Company ticker symbol"),
    filing_type: Optional[str] = Query(None, description="Type of filing to filter by"),
    limit: Optional[int] = Query(20, ge=1, le=100, description="Maximum number of filings to retrieve")
)
```

## Testing the Fixes

To test if the fixes properly resolved the issues:

1. Use the updated endpoint URLs:
   - `/api/v1/sec-data/{symbol}/filings` for retrieving SEC filings
   - `/api/v1/sec/{symbol}/analyze` for SEC filing analysis

2. Check for proper error handling:
   - Try with invalid symbols
   - Try with unavailable filing types

3. Verify response formatting:
   - Ensure all expected fields are present
   - Check proper date formatting
   - Verify document URLs are properly extracted

## Migration for Clients

Clients should update their API calls to use the new endpoint structure:

| Old Endpoint | New Endpoint |
|--------------|--------------|
| `/api/v1/sec/{symbol}/filings` | `/api/v1/sec-data/{symbol}/filings` |

The legacy endpoint is available temporarily to support a smooth transition.
