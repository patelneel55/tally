New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities can adversely affect the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business by increasing the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s costs, limiting the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business or supply chain. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied.Risks and costs related to new and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities may increase as the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.",

              "content": "The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply with the DMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153APIs\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission. Although the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compliance plan is intended to address the DMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153performance smartphones\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smartphones\u00e2\u20ac\u009d generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with Google LLC (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Google\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) and other companies to offer their search services on the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. On August 5, 2024, Google was found to have violated U.S. antitrust laws. In connection with this finding, the DOJ has proposed remedies, which include changes to Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products, services and business models. The proposed changes vary in scope and severity and range from imposing significant restrictions on Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s licensing agreements to prohibiting Google from offering the Company commercial terms for search distribution for up to 10 years. If implemented, such remedies could materially adversely affect the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to earn revenue from such licensing arrangements.There can be no assurance the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business, results of operations and financial condition will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, lost sales, and lower profit margins.",
